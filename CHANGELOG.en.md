## Unreleased

### Added

- **Rate-limit monitor `repowiki monitor <repo>`**: turns rate-limit symptoms observed
  by the driving session into deterministic concurrency reduction. The driver reports
  symptoms via `--report stream_error|timeout|cancel --worker <name>` when a subagent
  dies abnormally (`ok` resets the streak); 5 consecutive `stream_error` in a 10-minute
  sliding window, or a single `timeout`, or a single `cancel` enters throttled —
  `next --claim` then allows only 1 live claim (the throttle signal is also returned
  when the queue looks empty, so "throttled" is never mistaken for "no tasks"), while
  other workers wait per the "empty and busy>0" contract. After a 30-minute cooldown
  (`REPOWIKI_MONITOR_COOLDOWN`) it enters probing (the single slot is the probe); when
  the probe's task passes check it enters recovering, and every subsequent successful
  task raises the dispatch cap by 1 until the fleet size declared via `--workers N` is
  restored; new symptoms or no progress during probing return to throttled. The state
  machine is evaluated lazily (on next/check/status/monitor — no daemon), the ledger
  `state/monitor.json` follows the flock + atomic-replace discipline, and corruption
  preserves the scene with an explicit error. `status` gains a `monitor` section. New
  env vars `REPOWIKI_MONITOR_WINDOW` (default 600s) and `REPOWIKI_MONITOR_COOLDOWN`
  (default 1800s). 19 new tests (173 total green).
- **Progressive site rendering**: `site` no longer requires prior `finalize`. With
  partial completion (e.g., module-scoped generation) it writes a draft metadata
  (`_draft: true`) and renders only finished pages; once all tasks (including the
  overview) are done, `site` automatically runs `finalize` and renders the full-resolution
  wiki in one shot. Corrupted metadata follows the same self-healing rule (all done →
  rebuild full, incomplete → degrade to draft). Site summary gains `draft`/`finalized`
  fields with human-readable hints; in `--json` mode the nested `finalize` output no
  longer pollutes stdout.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-07

### Added

- Knowledge cards now cover the full lifecycle:
  - **update ↔ knowledge linkage**: `update` maps changed files against the knowledge plan — cards whose `source_files` changed and modules whose scope was touched each get an incremental refresh task (card updates carry a "## 5. Update Summary" section, enforced by `check` via `is_update`);
  - **site Knowledge Base chapter**: knowledge module docs and cards join `wiki.html` as regular pages under a dedicated nav chapter — searchable, with source popups and mermaid; card front matter is stripped for display;
  - **cross-epoch re-arm**: `update` regenerates specs of done `*-update` tasks from the previous round and resets them to pending — fixing the second update round silently doing nothing after a finalize.
- Knowledge YAML exports fill `source_files`: `_index.yaml` / `_module.yaml` collect the union of card source files falling under each module's scope (previously always empty).

### Fixed

- Removed unreachable dead code in `knowledge.py`.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Site drawer menu button**: the topbar `#menu-btn` is a dead control on desktop,
  where the sidebar is always visible; it now only shows on narrow screens (≤900px).

### Documentation

- Replaced the ASCII architecture diagram on both README landing pages with drawn
  diagrams (Chinese diagram for the Chinese README, English one for the English
  README); added the interactive architecture HTML and specs
  (`docs/repowiki-architecture*.html`/`.json`, with light/dark themes, path
  highlighting, and node search).
- Softened the "no LLM" self-description: the README lead and features now say
  "deterministic build"; the package description, CLI `--help`, and module docstring
  follow suit.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-09-05

### Added

- Centralized bilingual docs: `docs/` restructured into `zh/` + `en/` mirrors (CONTEXT,
  DECISIONS, and the ADRs moved in), plus a full English `CHANGELOG.en.md` and `docs/en/**`;
  README and CHANGELOG stay at the root (the GitHub landing page and the Releases page
  render them from there).
- English README (`README.en.md`); README polish: badges, a "Why repowiki" comparison,
  Features, Usage, a Roadmap, Contributing, community links, and a table of contents.

### Fixed

- **Locale auto-detection prefers README.md**: `detect_locale` used to take the first
  entry of `sorted(glob("README*"))` — `README.en.md` sorts before `README.md`, so a
  bilingual repo's `plan --replan` misdetected the output language as en. README.md now
  wins when present; the remaining README* files are only a fallback.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **Windows CI compatibility** (pre-existing issue, fixed in the same window as the two
  entries below): test fixtures' `read_text`/`write_text` calls lacked an explicit
  `encoding="utf-8"`, so 10 cases raised UnicodeDecodeError/UnicodeEncodeError under
  Windows' default cp1252; reading index.json in `state.py` and the `os.replace` atomic
  swap raced in both directions on Windows (CPython opens files without
  FILE_SHARE_DELETE, so reading or writing either side hits PermissionError) — readers
  and writers now both go through `.index.lock` with a short retry on the swap-in; the
  missing-lock-backend test now masks both `fcntl` and `msvcrt` (it previously masked
  only the POSIX side, making the test a no-op on Windows).
- **`watch` false stall reports**: when a task happened to complete between the
  top-of-loop snapshot and the stall decision, `ready_tasks` was already empty and the
  run was misreported as "stalled" with exit 1 — the stall is now re-confirmed against
  fresh stats before being declared.
- **Catalog validation rejects placeholder titles**: `validate_catalog` errors when a
  node title contains `{{...}}`-shaped template placeholders. Previously such titles
  slipped all the way into task specs and page H1s (templates.render substitutes by
  key and keeps unknown placeholders verbatim, so `{{TITLE}}` was filled back in as a
  literal), while output validation then judged that literal in the H1 an "unreplaced
  placeholder" — the task was unsolvable from the moment its spec was generated (in
  practice one page task burned all its retries this way). Planning rule 3 in both the
  zh/en catalog task templates now states the ban explicitly.
- **Placeholder scanning targets non-code text only**: the three "still contains an
  unreplaced template placeholder" checks (page/card/overview) now strip fenced code
  blocks and inline code before scanning — when a doc page legitimately discusses the
  placeholder mechanism, literal `{{...}}` inside code is content, not a defect; leftover
  placeholders in prose still fail. The regex was renamed to the public
  `repowiki.validate.PLACEHOLDER_RE` for reuse by catalog.py.

### Changed

- **Site viewer (wiki.html) visual overhaul**: design-token system (Chinese-glyph font
  stack, h1-h6 type scale, radius/shadow tokens), code-block header bar (language tag +
  copy button), sidebar on-page TOC + scroll-spy highlighting + section collapsing,
  layered dark theme, table zebra striping, mermaid card containers, prev/next paging,
  reading progress bar, top-bar SVG icons and breadcrumbs, search hit highlighting, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` / `:focus-visible` accessibility details. The payload
  structure and the single-file contract are unchanged (still exactly 4 inline scripts,
  zero external resources).

### Tests

- 2 new cases: catalog title containing a placeholder → error; placeholder inside a
  code block/inline code → passes. 149 tests green.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Native Windows support**: concurrent state control switched to dual stdlib lock
  backends (POSIX `fcntl` / Windows `msvcrt.locking`), removing the "POSIX only, use
  WSL on Windows" runtime gate; fixed two `split("/")` calls in `tasks.py` that picked
  the wrong repo name for backslash paths; the CI matrix gained `windows-latest`
  (3.10-3.13 fully); SKILL.md gained the PowerShell equivalents (`Get-Command`,
  `Start-Process` background watch). Runtime dependencies unchanged (pyyaml only).
- **`repowiki site <repo> [--open]`: single-file offline viewing site**. Run after
  finalize; renders all pages into one self-contained HTML (`<locale>/wiki.html`,
  about 4-5 MB): marked + mermaid render libraries embedded (vendored into the repo and
  shipped with the wheel, MIT), `file://` source references open popups showing the
  embedded line-numbered snippets, sidebar navigation, client-side full-text search,
  dark/light themes. Idempotent and re-runnable; still rebuildable from the on-disk
  pages after `repowiki clean` (section order degrades to directory order). The README
  Non-Goals entry "HTML preview service" was reworded to "resident preview server".

### Fixed

- Two frontend defects in the site viewer (found in post-release smoke testing, fixed
  in this release): clicking an on-page "TOC" anchor triggered the hash router and fell
  back to the overview page — anchor hashes now only scroll and never switch pages;
  navigation highlighting misused `querySelector` so only the first link participated
  in highlight switching — switched to `querySelectorAll`.
- The plugin manifest `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` lagged at 0.1.0; synced to 0.3.0
  with pyproject.

### Docs

- Added a root-level `CONTEXT.md` glossary (domain terms in three groups: artifacts /
  orchestration / execution).
- Added `docs/adr/0001` (stdlib dual-lock-backend trade-off for native Windows support)
  and `docs/adr/0002` (single-file offline site: motivation for withdrawing the
  Non-Goal and the alternatives considered).
- README: platform statement covers all three platforms, new "Viewing the Wiki (single-
  file offline site)" section, `site` added to the command table, offline install notes
  that the pyyaml wheel must match the target platform (Windows included).

### Tests

- 14 new cases in `tests/test_site.py`: payload assembly and navigation tree (including
  a section's own page), source-snippet line-range extraction and missing markers,
  `</script>` escaping protection, idempotent rebuilds, locale isolation, degraded
  build after clean, `--open`/`--json` behavior; the missing-lock-backend case now
  verifies the friendly "both backends unavailable" error. 140 tests green.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- **Removed `next --batch` (breaking)**: the worker contract already forbids holding
  more than one claim at a time, so the flag was a speculative interface with no
  consumers. `next` now hands out exactly one task per call (`ready_tasks(limit=1)`),
  and README / SKILL.md / tests were updated to "each next hands out one task". Just
  delete `--batch N` from old scripts.
- CLI dispatch simplified: removed the 13-line `handlers` dict in `main` in favor of
  `set_defaults(func=cmd_*)` on each subparser + `main` calling `args.func(args, paths)`
  directly; `getattr(args, "json", False)` simplified to `args.json`.
- Added a shared git subprocess helper `src/repowiki/gitutil.py`
  (`run_git(repo, *args, timeout)`); the four ad-hoc subprocess wrappers in scanner /
  metadata / knowledge / updater converged into one place; failures uniformly return
  `None`, and empty output is distinguishable from failure (preserving update's
  "empty diff = no changes" semantics).
- `state.stats()` outputs `busy` directly (reusing the stale determination), unifying
  the busy accounting across `next` / `watch` / `status` into one source; `run_next` no
  longer loads index.json a second time.
- finalize's `state/catalog.json` went from up to 3 parses per run to 1; removed the
  dumps→loads→dumps round-trip in `_emit`.

### Cleanup (ponytail whole-repo audit, ~76 lines removed net)

- Deleted declared-but-unconsumed dead code: `templates.placeholders`,
  `Inventory.to_dict`, `FileEntry.size`, `WikiPaths.repo_rel`, the `snapshot` inside
  `run_watch`, `i18n.module_optional_files`, `FlatNode.dir`, the `validate.check_catalog`
  forwarding wrapper, metadata's dead `uuid`/`datetime`/`Path` imports, etc.;
  `_expand_knowledge` dropped its unused `inv` parameter.
- dispatch's plan-task expansion branch changed from a "`(plan_file, expand)` tuple" to
  an explicit `if tid == "catalog"` check; removed a redundant local import in
  `_check_readonly`.
- No behavior changes beyond `--batch` above; 126 tests green.

### Docs

- README gained an "Offline install" section: the only runtime dependency is pyyaml,
  with the full offline path via `pip download` staging + `pip install --no-index`, and
  how to manually copy the skill directory.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-03

First public release.

- Deterministic task orchestrator: `plan` / `next` / `check` / `touch` / `watch` /
  `release` / `finalize` / `update` / `knowledge` / `status` / `clean`.
- catalog → page → overview three-phase task flow with atomic claiming, stale-claim
  reclamation, resumability, and automatic slim-down after finalize.
- Output language follows the target repo automatically (zh/en: deterministic detection
  with the README weighted highest, `plan --locale` to force, persisted in
  `state/locale`); validators, templates, and knowledge cards ship as language-matched
  sets, extensible via string tables.
- Validator + deterministic auto-repair (anchors, line ranges, H1, path separators).
- git-diff-based incremental updates (page rewrites gain an "Update Summary" section).
- Knowledge-card task set (mechanism cards + module docs).
- Distributed as an Agent Skill (`skills/repowiki/SKILL.md`); the CLI installs via
  `pip install git+…`.

### Changed

- Removed third-party brand references; repositioned as a generic repository wiki
  generator; the scanner no longer special-cases the old third-party output directory.

### Fixed

- **Self-healing queue**: expired claims left behind by dead workers are automatically
  reclaimed and re-queued by `next --claim` (previously `ready_tasks` excluded all
  in_progress tasks, so dead claims could only be cleared by manual `release --force`;
  in practice this froze 25% of pages for 50 minutes); stale determination unified to
  the claim directory's mtime as the single source; `watch` no longer counts expired
  claims as "executing", so a stall is reported promptly once all workers die. Default
  stale window 45→15 minutes (tunable via `REPOWIKI_STALE_SECONDS`).
- SKILL.md orchestration hardening: explicitly forbids the main session assigning task
  lists to workers (global FIFO pure pull) and forbids workers pre-claiming tasks
  (hold only one claim at a time); adds background watch instructions and exit-code
  trustworthiness warnings; adds environment variable docs.
- A corrupted `state/index.json` is no longer silently treated as an empty task list
  (previously one transactional write-back could lose the whole list); the scene is now
  preserved with an explicit error, and `plan --replan --force` is the explicit
  recovery path.
- A corrupted `state/catalog.json` produces a friendly error on the finalize / update /
  overview validation paths instead of a bare traceback.
- Nonexistent task ids (touch / release) produce a friendly error with troubleshooting
  pointers.
- First run on non-POSIX platforms (Windows) after install shows an explicit platform
  notice instead of crashing on a bare `fcntl` import.
