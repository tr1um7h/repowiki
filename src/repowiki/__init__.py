"""repowiki: deterministic repo-wiki build system driven by coding agents.

It plans tasks, validates agent-produced output, and assembles metadata;
intelligence is supplied by whatever agent drives the worker loop:

    loop: task = repowiki next --claim --json
          if empty and busy > 0: wait and retry   # others are mid-flight
          if empty and busy == 0: exit            # all done
          execute the task spec (read source, write output)
          repowiki check --task <id> --json       # auto-fix + status flip
